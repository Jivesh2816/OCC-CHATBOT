    "answer": "Dealing with neglected repairs is frustrating, but you have clear legal rights under the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA). Landlords must keep your unit in good repair and habitable. Here is the simple, two-step escalation plan:\n\n📝 Written Notice: Send your landlord a clear, written letter or email explaining the issue and giving them a reasonable date by which it should be fixed.\n\n⚖️ LTB Contact: If the issue is not resolved by that deadline, you can contact the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) to file an application for dispute resolution.\n\n🚨 If you face an immediate crisis, like an illegal eviction or a vital service disconnection (heat, water), contact the ministry's Rental Housing Enforcement Unit right away. We also strongly encourage you to use the WUSA Student Legal Protection Program for free advice and possible representation before you take formal action."

    "question": "Joint lease and roommate liability",
    "answer": "Joint leases carry significant financial risk that every student should understand. ⚠️ Under a joint lease, all tenants who sign are held **collectively and individually responsible** for the entire lease obligation. This means if one housemate fails to pay rent or causes damage, the landlord can pursue the remaining tenants for the full shortfall. **Protect Yourself**: • Choose housemates carefully • Create written agreements among tenants • Understand all lease terms before signing • Use WUSA's free legal counsel to review agreements **Remember**: The 'Joint Liability Trap' can be financially devastating. Always get legal advice before signing any joint lease!"
